## Why Lerna?

Lerna is a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages. It optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm. With Lerna, you can manage your project's dependencies across multiple packages more efficiently.

Most important features of Lerna:

- Parallel execution: Lerna can run scripts and commands across multiple packages in parallel, which can save time and speed up the development process.
- Caching: Lerna caches dependencies and avoids re-installing them every time a command is run, which can save time and disk space.
- Package versioning: Lerna manages the versioning of packages in the repository, making it easy to track changes and dependencies between packages.
- Independent versioning: Lerna supports independent versioning of packages, allowing packages to have their own version numbers and release cycles.
- Simplified development: Lerna simplifies the development process in a monorepo by providing a single command-line interface for managing and developing packages in the repository.
- Code sharing: Lerna makes it easy to share code between packages in the repository, reducing duplication and improving code maintainability.
